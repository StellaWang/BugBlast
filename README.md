BugBlast
========

A simplified version of the original Bomberman game created by Hudson Soft in 1983. (C++)

In Bug Blast, the player has to navigate through a series of mazes exterminating nasty bugs called Zumi using bug spray. After exterminating all of the Zumi within a given maze, the player may head to the Exit square on that level in order to advance to the next maze. The player wins by completing all of the mazes.

With brief framework provided by the professor, I implemented Actor.h Actor.cpp (contain the declaration and implementation of all the objects) and StudentWorld.h StudentWorld.cpp (contain implementation of all the game rules).
